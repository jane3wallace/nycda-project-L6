# NYCDA WD Lesson 6: <i>jQuery</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 4 Lecture 1. This project was to help familiarize yourself with jQuery and its syntax.

### Assignment:
* Create a “cheat sheet” jQuery file that contains examples of all of the things we learned today, delineated with comments

* Create a web page with 4 different jQuery events. Have at least one of them be initiated by a click event.
